Based on the given information, I would suggest getting the best deal by purchasing the following cards from TCG Player:

* Arcane Signet: $0.27
* Fellwar Stone: $0.60
* Fetid Pools: $0.32
* Gonti, Lord of Luxury: $0.17

**Total Price:** $10.95

This is because TCG Player has lower prices on all of these cards except for Grima, Saruman's Footman, which is unavailable on Card Kingdom anyway.

**Note:** You may also want to consider purchasing Murder from Card Kingdom for $0.35, as it is unavailable on TCG Player. However, this will increase the total price to $11.30.

Overall, TCG Player offers the best deal on the majority of the cards on your list.
